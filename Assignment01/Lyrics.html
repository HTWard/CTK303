                <p>  Go, go, go, go, go, go</p>
                <p>  Go, shorty </p>
                <p>  It's your birthday </p>
                <p>  We gon' party like it's your birthday </p>
                <p>  We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday </p>
                <p>  And you know we don't give a fuck it's not your birthday </p>
                <p>  You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'</p>
                <p>  Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs </p>
                <p>  I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love </p>
                <p>  So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed </p>
                <p>  You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'</p>
                <p>  Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs </p>

                <p>  So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed </p>
                <p>  When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs </p>
                <p>  When I roll 20 deep, it's 20 knives in the club </p>
                <p>  Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love </p>
                <p>  When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they wanna fuck </p>
                <p>  But, homie, ain't nothing change hoes down, G's up </p>
                <p>  I see Xzibit in the cut, that nigga roll that weed up </p>
                <p>  If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a playa or pimp </p>
                <p>  Been hit wit' a few shells, but I don't walk wit' a limp (I'm ight) </p>
                <p>  In the hood, in L.A., they saying "50 you hot" </p>
                <p>  They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac </p>
                <p>  But holla, in New York them niggas'll tell ya I'm loco </p>
                <p>  And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold </p>
                <p>  I'm full of focused man, my money on my mind </p>
                <p>  I got a mill' out the deal and I'm still on the grind </p>
                <p>  Now shorty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow </p>
                <p>  Her girlfriend wanna get bi and they ready to go </p>
                <p>  You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub' </p>
                <p>  Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs </p>
                <p>  I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love </p>
                <p>  So come give me a hug, if you into getting rubbed </p>

                <p>  That bought me all my fancy things </p>
                <p>  My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels </p>
                <p>  Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't change </p>
                <p>  And you should love it, way more then you hate it </p>

                <p>  I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life </p>
                <p>  You that faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back, right? </p>
                <p>  When my jaws get to bumpin' in the club it's on </p>
                <p>  I wink my eye at you, bitch, if she smiles she gone </p>
                <p>  If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn </p>
                <p>  If the talk ain't 'bout money, homie, I ain't concerned </p>
                <p>  I'm a tell you what Banks told me, "Cuz, go 'head switch the style up </p>
                <p>  If the niggas hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up" </p>
                <p>  Or we can go upside your head wit' a bottle of bub' </p>
                <p>  They know where we fuckin' be </p>
                <p>  You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub' </p>
                <p>  Look, mami, I got the X, if you into takin' drugs </p>
