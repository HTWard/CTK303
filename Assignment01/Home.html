        <p>This website is to celebrate my birthday and tell you about "In Da Club" by 50 Cent. I know absolutely nothing about 50 Cent or this song, so I think it'll get really interesting. The main purpose is to show how cool of a website I can make, so that doesn't really matter. Someday they'll be even cooler, but this is what we have for now!</p>
